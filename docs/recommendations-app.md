# Architecture Recommendations App

A customer-facing web application that provides Azure architecture recommendations based on application context data.

## Prerequisites

This application requires an **application context file** generated by [Dr. Migrate](https://drmigrate.com). Context files are created during the migration planning process when you [assess an application with AppCat](https://learn.drmigrate.com/docs/using-dr-migrate/migration-planning/appcat-github-integration/).

If you don't have a Dr. Migrate context file, you can use the [sample files](../examples/context_files/) for testing.

## Overview

This Streamlit-based application allows customers to:
1. Upload their Dr. Migrate context file (JSON)
2. Review application summary information
3. Answer optional clarification questions
4. Receive tailored architecture recommendations
5. Export results as PDF or JSON

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adamswbrown/azure-architecture-categoriser-.git
cd azure-architecture-categoriser-

# Install with recommendations app dependencies
pip install -e ".[recommendations-app]"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ensure you have a catalog file (or generate one first)
# See: docs/catalog-builder.md

# Run the application (macOS/Linux)
./bin/start-recommendations-app.sh

# Run the application (Windows PowerShell)
.\bin\start-recommendations-app.ps1
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### No Strong Matches

When the scoring engine cannot find architectures that strongly match your requirements, the app displays a helpful guidance screen instead of empty results:

**What you'll see:**
- ⚠️ Warning banner explaining no strong matches were found
- **What we understood** - Key drivers extracted from your context file
- **Possible reasons** - Common explanations for low match scores
- **Suggestions to improve results** - Actionable steps including:
  - Answer unanswered clarification questions
  - Review and enrich your context file
  - Browse Azure Architecture Center manually
  - Consult with an Azure specialist

**Common causes:**
- Unique or specialized technology combinations
- Missing details about scalability or availability requirements
- Context file lacks sufficient technical detail
- Application requirements don't map to standard patterns

**Recommended actions:**
1. Return to Step 2 and answer all clarification questions
2. Ensure your Dr. Migrate context file includes App Modernization results
3. Manually explore the [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/browse) for inspiration

## Context File Format

Context files are generated by Dr. Migrate during the AppCat assessment process. The file is a JSON array containing application assessment data with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "app_overview": [
      {
        "application": "MyApplication",
        "app_type": "Web Application",
        "business_criticality": "High",
        "treatment": "replatform"
      }
    ],
    "detected_technology_running": [
      "Java",
      "Spring Boot",
      "PostgreSQL",
      "Redis"
    ],
    "server_details": [
      {
        "ServerName": "app-server-01",
        "environment": "Production",
        "OperatingSystem": "Windows Server 2019"
      }
    ],
    "App Mod results": [
      {
        "technology": "Java",
        "summary": {
          "container_ready": true,
          "modernization_feasible": true
        },
        "recommended_targets": ["Azure App Service", "Azure Kubernetes Service"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `app_overview` | Array with application metadata |
| `app_overview[].application` | Application name |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `app_overview[].app_type` | Application type (Web, API, Batch, etc.) |
| `app_overview[].business_criticality` | Business criticality level |
| `app_overview[].treatment` | Migration treatment (rehost, replatform, refactor, etc.) |
| `detected_technology_running` | Array of detected technologies |
| `server_details` | Array of server information |
| `App Mod results` | App Modernization assessment results |

## Configuration

### Catalog Location

The app looks for the architecture catalog in this order:

1. **User-selected**: Upload or specify path via the sidebar
2. **Environment variable**: `ARCHITECTURE_CATALOG_PATH`
3. **Current directory**: `./architecture-catalog.json`
4. **Project root**: `<project>/architecture-catalog.json`

The sidebar shows the currently loaded catalog including:
- Number of architectures
- Source location
- Last modified date
- Full file path

You can change catalogs at any time using the sidebar:
- **Upload** a catalog JSON file directly
- **Enter a path** to an existing catalog file
- **Reset** to auto-detection

```bash
# Use a custom catalog via environment variable
export ARCHITECTURE_CATALOG_PATH=/path/to/my-catalog.json
./bin/start-recommendations-app.sh
```

### Theme Configuration

The app uses a light theme by default. Configuration is in `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#0078D4"
backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F5F5F5"
textColor = "#333333"
```

## PDF Report

The generated PDF report includes:

1. **Header** - Title, application name, generation date
2. **Executive Summary** - Key metrics in a table
3. **Key Drivers** - Factors driving the recommendations
4. **Key Considerations** - Potential risks or challenges
5. **Your Answers** - Clarification questions you answered (if any)
6. **Recommendations** - Each recommendation with:
   - Architecture diagram (SVG and PNG supported)
   - Match score and quality level
   - Description
   - Why it fits / Potential challenges
   - Core Azure services
   - Learn URL

The PDF generator uses `reportlab` for PDF creation and `svglib` for SVG diagram conversion.

## Confidence Levels Explained

Each architecture recommendation includes a **match score** (0-100%) and a **confidence level**:

| Confidence Level | Score Range | Meaning |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **High** | 60%+ | Strong match for your requirements |
| **Medium** | 50-59% | Good match with some considerations |
| **Low** | <50% | Moderate match, review carefully |

The confidence thresholds were calibrated based on typical migration patterns. A "Medium" confidence score of 50%+ indicates the architecture reasonably aligns with your application's needs, even if it's not a perfect fit.

**Answering clarification questions** improves the accuracy of both the scoring and confidence assessment, as the scoring engine can better understand your specific requirements and constraints.

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,recommendations-app]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Errors (400 Bad Request)

**Problem**: Uploading a context file shows "400 Bad Request" error in browser console.

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **CORS/XSRF Configuration** (Most common in Azure deployments)
   - Streamlit's default CORS and XSRF protection settings can conflict
   - **Solution**: This is automatically configured in the Docker image. If running locally and experiencing this:
     - The app is designed to work with a reverse proxy (like Azure Container Apps) handling TLS/authentication
     - Ensure `STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_CORS=true` in your environment

2. **File Size Exceeds Limit** (>10MB)
   - Maximum context file size is 10MB
   - **Solution**: Reduce file size or remove unnecessary data

3. **Network/Proxy Issues** (In corporate environments)
   - Firewalls or proxies may block file uploads
   - **Solution**:
     - Check with your IT department for file upload restrictions
     - Try uploading from a different network
     - Contact support if the issue persists

### Sample Files Not Found (Try a Sample)

**Problem**: Clicking "Try a Sample" shows "File not found" in Azure deployments but works locally.

**Cause**: Path resolution differences between local development and Docker containers.

**Solution**: This has been fixed in the latest version with robust path resolution:
- The app now searches multiple locations automatically
- Ensures examples are found in Docker deployments
- If you're still experiencing issues:
  1. Check that you're running version 1.1.0 or later
  2. Verify the Docker image was rebuilt after the fix
  3. Restart the container to ensure the latest version is running

### "Architecture catalog not found"

Ensure you have a catalog file. Generate one using:
```bash
catalog-builder build-catalog --repo-path ./architecture-center --out architecture-catalog.json
```

### "Validation Error" on upload

Check that your context file:
- Is valid JSON
- Is an array with at least one object
- Contains `app_overview` with an `application` name
- Includes `detected_technology_running` and `server_details` fields

If validation fails, the app provides specific error messages and suggestions for fixing the file.

### No images in recommendations

Only ~20% of catalog entries have architecture diagrams. The app gracefully handles missing images.

### PDF generation fails

Ensure `reportlab` and `svglib` are installed:
```bash
pip install reportlab>=4.0.0 svglib>=1.5.0
```

### No recommendations shown

If you see "No Strong Matches Found":
1. Return to Step 2 and answer all clarification questions
2. Verify your context file has detailed technology information
3. Check that App Modernization results are included
4. Consider manually browsing Azure Architecture Center for your use case
